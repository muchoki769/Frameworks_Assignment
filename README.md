# Reflection on challenges and learning
While building this mini-app, I learned how to clean text data, extract dates,create columns and create visualizations directly in a Streamlit app.The biggest challenges were handling missing values and very large strings for the word cloud.Solving them taught me to check column names carefully and to generate word clouds from pre-calculated frequencies for large datasets. I also became comfortable using interactive widgets such as sliders and dropdowns to filter data dynamically.
